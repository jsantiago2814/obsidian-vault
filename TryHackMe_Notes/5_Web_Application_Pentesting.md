# Web Application Pentesting
## Enumeration & Brute Force
### Introduction
- Authentication enumeration is a fundamental aspect of security testing, concentrating specifically on the mechanisms that protect sensitive aspects of web applications; this process involves methodically inspecting various authentication components ranging from username validation to password policies and session management.
### Authentication Enumeration
- Think of yourself as a digital detective. It's not just about picking up clues, it's about understanding what these clues reveal about the security of a system. This is essentially what authentication enumeration involves.
- **Identifying Valid Usernames** - knowing a valid username lets an attacker focus just on the password. You can figure out usernames in different ways, like observing how the application responds during login or password resets. 
- **Password Policies** - The guidelines when creating passwords can provide valuable insights into the complexity of the passwords used in an application. 
- Common Places to Enumerate
	- **Registration Pages** - Web applications typically make the user registration process straightforward and informative by immediately indicating whether an email or username is available.
	- **Password Reset Features** - Password reset mechanisms are designed to help users regain access to their accounts by entering their details to receive reset instructions. However, the differences in the application's response can unintentionally reveal sensitive information.
	- **Verbose Errors** - Verbose error messages during login attempts or other interactive processes can reveal too much. 
	- **Data Breach Information** - Data from previous security breaches is a goldmine for attackers as it allows them to test whether compromised usernames and passwords are reused across different platforms.
### Enumerating Users via Verbose Errors
- Verbose errors can turn into a goldmine of information, providing insights such as: Internal Paths, Database Details, and User Information.
- **Inducting Verbose Errors** - Some common techniques used to provoke these errors: Invalid Login Attempts, SQL Injection, File Inclusion/Path Traversal, Form Manipulation, and Application Fuzzing. 
- When it comes to breaching authentication, enumeration and brute forcing often go hand in hand:
- **User Enumeration:** Discovering valid usernames sets the stage, reducing the guesswork in subsequent brute-force attacks.
- **Exploiting Verbose Errors:** The insights gained from these errors can illuminate aspects like password policies and account lockout mechanisms, paving the way for more effective brute-force strategiescd
